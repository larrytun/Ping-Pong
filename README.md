## Description

_This is my third solo project for Epicodus. It is a web application that counts up to a given number entered by the user. While visibly counting up to the entered number it will also show what numbers are divisible by 3, 5 ,or 15. If divisible by 3 it will give a result of "Ping". If divisible by 5 it will give a result of "Pong". If divisible by 15 it will give a result of "Ping-Pong"_
